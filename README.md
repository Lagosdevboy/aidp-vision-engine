## GPU Usage (AIDP)

AIDP‑Nexus deploys NVIDIA Llama‑3.1‑Nemotron‑Nano‑VL‑8B on AIDP GPU compute using NVIDIA NIM.
The model runs GPU‑accelerated inference workloads, and the agent sends real‑time
requests to the GPU‑hosted endpoint to generate market intelligence and insights.

GPU acceleration is required to support low‑latency reasoning, scalable inference,
and agent‑driven market analysis.
